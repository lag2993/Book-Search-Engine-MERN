# <Book-Search-Engine-MERN>
  
## Description
  As a developer I want to design a MERN application for avid readers. Where users can search for new books to read and keep a list of books to purchase. 
  
## Installation
Navigate to the root folder of the application in a terminal. Then run npm install to download all the neccessary dependencies. 

## Usage
   The landing page leads users to the search feature for books. User can type into the search bar and several books will be displayed that relate to the search term. If the user wants to create a list, first they must sign up for an account. Then a button will apear on searched books page that will allow users to add to the saved books list. This list can be observed by clicking on the saved Books nav bar option.
